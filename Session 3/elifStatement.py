"""
Really Important Note!
1. You can only add an elif or else after an if
2. You can add multiple elif statements, but there can only be one if statement and one else statement
3. Once you add an else statement statement, then you can't add an if or elif
4. You need to add an if to a if-elif-else statement, but elif and else are not mandatory
5. Here is a really big if-elif-else statement - 

if x:
    ---Some code---
elif y:
    ---Some code---
(Multiple more elifs)
else z:
    ---Some code---
